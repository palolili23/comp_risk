# Project on Competing Risks

This repository contains code to estimate the different estimates proposed in the following paper [by Young et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06136).


The example dataset is **Byar & Greene prostate cancer data**, downloaded from the following [website](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/DataSets).

The estimates are presented as follows:

**Direct Effects:**

- Via G-formula (35)

- Via IPW (36)


**Total Effects:**

- Via G-formula (37) (*In process*)

- Via IPW Sub-distribution hazard (38)

- Via IPW Cause-specific hazard (39) (*In process*)

Currently, the folder `01_functions` contains the code for the following:

- `n_estimate_function`: Is the function for the estimate

- `n_bootsamples`: The boostrap function for the estimate

- `n_wrapper`: A function that wraps the estimate and bootsamples results, creates a tibble with all the results for all timepoints.

- `risk_diff_ratio`: Uses the output from `n_wrapper` to calculate the following estimates (with 95% Confidence intervals):   

  -- $E(Y^{a=0})$

  -- $E(Y^{a=1})$
  
  -- $E(Y^{a=1}) - E(Y^{a=0})$
  
  -- $\frac{E(Y^{a=1})}{E(Y^{a=0})}$
  
- `survival_graph`: Contains two different functions:

  -- `cif_curves`: creates curves for the cumulative incidence
  
  -- `surv_curves`: creates the survival curves.
